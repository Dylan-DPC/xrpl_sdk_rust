# XRP Ledger JSONRPC client

A strongly-typed client for the XRP Ledger JSONRPC API.

This crate is an *unofficial*, community-driven effort.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
xrpl_sdk_jsonrpc = "0.6"
```

## Usage

```rust
    let client = Client::new();

    let account = env::var("XRPL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS").unwrap();

    let resp = client.account_tx(&account).limit(5).send().await;

    dbg!(&resp);
```

## FAQ

### Why provide both execute and send methods for API endpoint handlers?

Providing the lower-level `execute` method allows for more flexibility. Since `execute` is generic you can pass any type of object to deserialize the response to, e.g. you could deserialize to a `HashMap` instead of the 'default' response for each API call. Or you could use a custom struct with only the fields you are interested in.
