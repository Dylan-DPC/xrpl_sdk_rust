# XRP Ledger WebSocket Client

A strongly-typed client for the XRP Ledger WebSocket API.

This crate is an *unofficial*, community-driven effort.

## Usage

```rust
let mut client = Client::connect(DEFAULT_WS_URL)
    .await
    .expect("cannot connect");

let req = SubscribeRequest::streams(&["ledger"]);
client.call(req).await.expect("cannot subscribe");

let (_, rx) = client.stream.split();

tokio::pin!(rx);

while let Some(msg) = rx.next().await {
    dbg!(&msg);
}
```
